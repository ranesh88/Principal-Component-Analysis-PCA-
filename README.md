## What Is Principal Component Analysis? 

Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a dimensionality reduction method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set.

## What are the objectives of principal component analysis?

Data compression: PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets, making them easier to store and analyze. Feature extraction: PCA can be used to identify the most important features in a dataset, which can be used to build predictive models.
